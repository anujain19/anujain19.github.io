Such avowals, and plenty more philosophical and comical ones, are painted on auto rickshaws, trucks, and buses throughout the country. Reading these and pondering their relevance to life is a pursuit that helps keep my mind off traffic and pollution.<br><br>Another very common declaration on auto rickshaws is “<em>Buri nazar wale, tera moonh kala</em>”, which translates to, “To the one with the evil eye, may your face be blackened”. In the Indian culture a face is blackened to insult an individual. However, walking to my hotel in Dehradun I saw a parked auto rickshaw that said-<br><br><em>Buri nazar wale, tera bhi bhala ho</em><br>To the one with the evil eye, may you be blessed as well.<br><br>I stopped. I read the saying again. This was a first for sure! A diminutive smile sprung on my lips. I chuckled. In spite of the blazing sun overhead, I felt a wisp of cool shade find its way to my heart.<br><br>I went over the auto rickshaw person. “Where to?” he asked, I answered, “I don’t really need to go anywhere, but may I speak with you for a minute?” He looked at me quizzically through his over-sized sun glasses, shifted a bit in his bright red, skin-tight, transparent shirt that showed off his bulging biceps. Then ignoring me, he started digging under his extra-long hot-pink painted pinky with a screw driver. I repeated my question and he shrugged his shoulder nonchalantly; reminding me of my teenager saying, “What ever.”<br><br>Deciding to get to the point, I asked him, “This saying written on your auto, did you get it painted?” <br><br>“Yes, why?” he quipped.<br><br>“I found it very interesting. What made you change the ‘black face’ one to this one?”<br><br>He laughed. The sun glasses came off. I could see his large black eyes lighten up. “Madam <em>ji</em>, I like breaking things. I broke my parents dream when I dropped out of school. I break a bottle of alcohol every night. I break the hearts of girls in this city. I break the bodies of people who mess with me. This time I decided to break something different- the chain”.<br><br>I reminded myself to breathe. And asked, “Break which chain <em>ji</em>?” The ‘ji’ tumbled out on its own. I wanted to ensure he felt respected. <br><br>“The chain of evil eyes, Madam ji. See, if you look at me with an evil eye, and I blacken your face, you will look at me the same way again. The evil will keep coming back to me. Instead if I ask God to bless you; I break the chain of evil eyes and black faces. Better for me too, <em>correct na</em>”, he said it all in one breath. <br><br>Wow! Could breaking something ever be better?</p><p> </p></div><footer class="post__footer"><div class="post__footer__col"><ul class="post__tag"><li><a href="https://anujain.me/tag/stories/">The Spell of Stories</a></li></ul><div class="post__share"></div></div></footer></article><div class="comments u-wrapper"><h3 class="u-h5">Comments</h3><div id="disqus_thread"></div><script>var disqus_config = function () {
